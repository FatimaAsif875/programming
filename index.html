<h1>The 3 most papular programming languages in 2020</h1>
<h2><u>PYTHON</u></h2>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<h4><p>Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.</p></h4>
<h3>Important uses:</h3>
<h4> Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python</h4>

<h2><u>JAVA SCRIPT</u></h2>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<h4><p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well.</h4></p>
<h3>Important uses:</h3>
<h4>JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based applications, which do not require users to download an application.</h4>

<h2><u>C++</u></h2>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<h4><p>C++ is an extension of C that works well for programming the systems that run applications, as opposed to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for multi-device and multi-platform systems. Over time, programmers have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++. Being able to use these utilities effectively is just as important to understanding a programming language as writing code, Gorton says.</h4></p>
<h3>Important uses:</h3>
<h4> C++ has many uses and is the language behind everything from computer games to mathematical simulations</h4>
